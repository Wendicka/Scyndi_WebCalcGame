# Web Calculation Game


This is just a web game in which you can practise calculation, written in Scyndi.

Please note in order to "compile" you'll need Scorpion version 19.02.14 or later.
The "makefile" may need to be edited based on where you have installed Scorpion and it assumes Scorpion is properly configured, if all that is the case,the makefile should just work with "make". (Hey, nobody said "make" was only for C projects) :P

I do need to note, that this is just a demonstration of what Scyndi can do, but as Scyndi is still premature as a programming language, you may still see some parts covered up with 'pure' JavaScript, and some things in the source code looking more complicated, than when I would just have used 'real JavaScript'. Don't start to moan at me about "why not learning JavaScript", as the point of this project was not the calculation game itself, but rather to demonstrate Scyndi can create web based stuff. This project was also set up to see how some basis modules in which JavaScript will be interfaced with Scyndi should properly operate or be written. So the code itself is the study material here :P


Feel free to look around in the .ssf files (Scyndi Source File) to get a bit of the basic idea on how Scyndi works.
